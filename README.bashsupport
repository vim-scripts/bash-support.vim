README for bash-support.vim (Version 3.0) / November 26 2009

  *  INSTALLATION

  *  FILES
  *  ADDITIONAL TIPS

Bash Support implements a bash-IDE for Vim/gVim. It is written to considerably
speed up writing code in a consistent style.  This is done by inserting
complete statements, comments, idioms, and code snippets.  Syntax checking,
running a script, starting a debugger  can be done with a keystroke.  There are
many additional hints and options which can improve speed and comfort when
writing shell scripts.

  INSTALLATION
=======================================================================================

The subdirectories in the zip archive  bash-support.zip  mirror the directory
structure which is needed below the local installation directory $HOME/.vim/ .

(1) Copy the zip archive  bash-support.zip to $HOME/.vim and run

      unzip bash-support.zip

    If you have already an older version of bash-support and you have modified
    the template files you may want to save your templates first or copy the
    files from the archive by hand.

(2) Loading of plugin files must be enabled. If not use
      :filetype plugin on
    This is the minimal content of the file '$HOME/.vimrc'. Create one if there
    is none. 

(3) Set at least some personal details into bash-support/templates/Templates by
    overriding the defaults.  Here the minimal personalization (my settings as
    an example, of course):

      |AUTHOR|    = Dr. Fritz Mehner 
      |AUTHORREF| = fgm
      |EMAIL|     = mehner@fh-swf.de
      |COMPANY|   = FH Südwestfalen, Iserlohn
      |COPYRIGHT| = Copyright (c) |YEAR|, |AUTHOR|

    Please read the documentation to fully understand the template system.

(4) Consider additional settings in the file '$HOME/.vimrc'.
    The files customization.vimrc and customization.gvimrc are replacements or
    extensions for your .vimrc and .gvimrc ( _vimrc and _gvimrc under Windows).
    You may want to use parts of them. The files are documented. 

There are a lot of features and options which can be used and influenced:

  *  use of template files and tags
  *  using and managing personal code snippets
  *  bash dictionary for keyword completion
  *  removing the root menu
  *  using additional plugins

Restart gVim/Vim generate the help tags 

  :helptags ~/.vim/doc

and look at the bashsupport help with

  :help bashsupport

=======================================================================================
  ADDITIONAL TIPS
=======================================================================================

(1) gvim. Toggle 'insert mode' <--> 'normal mode' with the right mouse button
    (see mapping in file customization.gvimrc).

(2) gvim. Use tear off menus and

(3) try 'Focus under mouse' as window behavior (No mouse click when the mouse
    pointer is back from the menu entry).

(4) Use Emulate3Buttons "on" (X11) even for a 3-button mouse. Pressing left and
    right button simultaneously without moving your fingers is faster then
    moving a finger to the middle button (often a wheel).
