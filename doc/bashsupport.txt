bash Support                                      *bash-support* *bashsupport*
                             Plugin version 2.7
                        for Vim version 7.0 and above

Bash Support implements a bash-IDE for Vim/gVim. It is written to considerably
speed up writing code in a consistent style.  This is done by inserting
complete statements, comments, idioms, and code snippets.  Syntax checking,
running a script, starting a debugger  can be done with a keystroke.  There
are many additional hints and options which can improve speed and comfort when
writing shell scripts.

        How to add this help file to Vim's help  |add-local-help|


==============================================================================
1.  USAGE with GUI  (gVim)                            *bashsupport-usage-gvim*
==============================================================================

If the menus are not visible call them with the entry "Load Bash Support"
in the standard Tools-menu.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.1  MENU 'Comments'                                    *bashsupport-comments*
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.1.1 APPEND ALIGNED COMMENTS TO CONSECUTIVE LINES  *bashsupport-aligned-comm*
--------------------------------------------------

In NORMAL MODE the menu entry
 'Line End Comm.'
will append a comment to the current line.

In VISUAL MODE this entry will append aligned comments to all marked lines.
Marking the 4 lines

 x11=11;
 x1111=1111;

 x11111111=11111111;

and choosing 'Line End Comm.' will yield

 x11=11;                                        # |
 x1111=1111;                                    #

 x11111111=11111111;                            #

The cursor position above is marked by '|' . Empty lines will be ignored.

The default starting column is 49 ( = (multiple of 2,4, or 8) + 1 ).  This can
be changed by setting a global variable in the file '.vimrc', e.g. :

  let g:BASH_LineEndCommColDefault    = 45

The starting column can also be set by the menu entry 'Comments->Set End Comm.
Col.' . Just position the cursor in an arbitrary column (column number is
shown in the Vim status line) and choose this menu entry.  This setting is
buffer related.

If the cursor was at the end of a line you will be asked for a column number
because this position is most likely not the desired starting column.
Your choice will be confirmed.


1.1.2 CODE TO COMMENT                               *bashsupport-code-to-comm*
---------------------

A marked block will be changed into

 #x11=11;
 #x1111=1111;
 #
 #x11111111=11111111;

The menu entry works also for a single line. A single line needs not to be
marked (normal mode).


1.1.3 COMMENT TO CODE                               *bashsupport-comm-to-code*
---------------------

A marked block

 #x11=11;
 x1111=1111;

 #x11111111=11111111;

will be changed into

 x11=11;
 x1111=1111;

 x11111111=11111111;

The menu entry works also for a single line. A single line needs not to be
marked (normal mode).


1.1.4 FRAME COMMENTS, FILE HEADER, ...            *bashsupport-comm-templates*
--------------------------------------

Frame comments, function descriptions and file header comments are read as
templates from the appropriate files (see |bashsupport-tempfiles|).

1.1.5 COMMENT/UNCOMMENT WITH echo                      *bashsupport-comm-echo*
---------------------------------

The echo-entry in the Comments-menu can be used to put one or more statements
in a sort of comment. This is usually done for testing:

 echo "rm -f $allfiles"

This can only be done in normal mode: The complete line (from the first
non-blank to the end) is framed with  echo "..." ; the cursor will be then
moved to the next line. Now this line can be framed and so forth.

The remove-echo-entry removes an echo.  The keyword echo, the following double
quotation mark and the last double quotation mark in the current line will be
removed; the cursor will then be moved to the next line.

Longer sections of a script are better commented out with set options
|bashsupport-set|.

1.1.6 KEYWORD+comment                              *bashsupport-comm-keywords*
---------------------

Preliminary line end comments to document (and find again) places where work
will be resumed shortly, like

   # :TODO:12.05.2004:Mn: <your comment>

Usually not meant for the final documentation.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.2  MENU 'Statements'                                *bashsupport-statements*
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.2.1  NORMAL MODE, INSERT MODE.                   *bashsupport-stat-norm-ins*
--------------------------------

An empty statement will be inserted and properly indented. The entry 'if'
will insert an if-statement:

 if
 then
 fi

The statements will be indented.

The for-, if-, if-else-, select-, until- and while-statement can be changed
so that the 'do' or 'then' stands on the first line:

 if  ; then
 fi

This is achieved by setting the global variable g:BASH_DoOnNewLine in '.vimrc':

  let g:BASH_DoOnNewLine   = 'yes'

The default value is 'no'.


1.2.2  VISUAL MODE                                   *bashsupport-stat-visual*
------------------
The highlighted area (...) will be surrounded by a statement, parentheses,
quotes or an echo with quotes:

  for in do ... done
  if then ... fi
  if then ... else fi
  select  in do ... done
  until do ... done
  while do ... done
  function NAME () { ... }

  ${...}
  $(...)
  $((...))
  $[[...]]

  echo -e "...\n"

  ${...[@]}
  ${...[*]}
  ${#...[*]}
  ${!...[*]}

1.2.3 CODE SNIPPETS                                *bashsupport-stat-snippets*
-------------------

Code snippets are pieces of code which are kept in separate files in a special
directory. File names are used to identify the snippets.  The default snippet
directory is  '$HOME/.vim/bash-support/codesnippets'.  Snippets are managed
with the 3 entries

   bash -> Statements -> read  code snippet
   bash -> Statements -> write code snippet
   bash -> Statements -> edit  code snippet

from the Statements submenu.

Creating a new snippet:
-----------------------
When nothing is marked, "write code snippet" will write the whole buffer
to a snippet file, otherwise the marked area will be written to a file.

Insert a snippet:
-----------------
Select the appropriate file from the snippet directory ("read  code snippet").
The inserted lines will be indented.

Indentation / no indentation
----------------------------
Code snippets are normally indented after insertion. To suppress indentation
add the file extension "ni" or "noindent" to the snippet file name, e.g.

  parameter_handling.sh.noindent


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.3  MENU 'set'                                              *bashsupport-set*
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Calling a set-command (submenu "set") in NORMAL or INSERT MODE will set this
option, e.g.

 set -o posix

Calling a set-command (submenu "set") for a marked block (VISUAL MODE)

 rm "$alldirs"
 echo "$alldirs gone"

will set this option above this block and unset it below:

set -o posix             # SetOptionNumber_1
 rm "$alldirs"
 echo "$alldirs gone"
set +o posix             # SetOptionNumber_1

The option numbers SetOptionNumber_xxx are automatically incremented. They can
be searched for with the vim star command (*).


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.4  MENU 'shopt'                                          *bashsupport-shopt*
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Calling a shopt-command (submenu "shopt") in NORMAL or INSERT MODE will set
this option, e.g.

 shopt -s shift_verbose

Calling a shopt-command (submenu "shopt") for a marked block (VISUAL MODE)

 function1 22 33 55
 function2 "cc"

will set this option above this block and unset it below:

shopt -s shift_verbose       # ShoptOptionNumber_1
 function1 22 33 55
 function2 "cc"
shopt -u shift_verbose       # ShoptOptionNumber_1

The option numbers ShoptOptionNumber_xxx are automatically incremented. They
can be searched for with the vim star command (*).

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.5  MENU 'Regex'                                          *bashsupport-regex*
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

These menu can be used to compose regular expressions with a few keystrokes.
In normal mode the entries insert the shown constructs after the cursor. The
first group ( "*(|)" , ... ) and the entry '[ ]' can enclose a marked text.
The marked text
  xxxxx
will be changed into
  *(xxxxx|)
by the first choice.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.6  MENU 'Run'                                              *bashsupport-run*
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.6.1 Save and run                                    *bashsupport-run-script*
------------------

Save the current buffer to his file and run this file. The command line, the
applied parameters and the shell return code are shown in the bottom line.

 * In NORMAL MODE the whole buffer will be executed.
 * In VISUAL MODE only the marked lines will be executed.

There are three output destinations (see|bashsupport-output|).  If the output
destination is VIM runtime errors are caught in an error window allowing
quickfix commands to be used (see|quickfix|).


1.6.2 Save and check syntax                         *bashsupport-syntax-check*
---------------------------

Save the current buffer to this file and run this file with the -n flag
(bash: Read commands but do not execute them).
Errors are listed in an error window; now the quickfix commands can be used.

The syntax check can be influenced by shopt options. Options which shall
always take effect can be declared in '.vimrc' , e.g.

  let g:BASH_SyntaxCheckOptionsGlob  = "-O extglob"

These options can be augmented or canceled using the menu entry 'syntax check
options' typing for instance

  +O extglob -O nocaseglob

after the prompt. The options entered this way are buffer related.  The global
options set in '.vimrc' and the buffer related options are checked.  Only the
shopts options for Bash (GNU Bash-3.2, manual: 2006 September 27) are
recognized:

   cdable_vars        cdspell         checkhash    checkwinsize
   cmdhist            dotglob         execfail     expand_aliases
   extdebug           extglob         extquote     failglob
   force_fignore      gnu_errfmt      histappend   histreedit
   histverify         hostcomplete    huponexit    interactive_comments
   lithist            login_shell     mailwarn     no_empty_cmd_completion
   nocaseglob         nullglob        progcomp     promptvars
   restricted_shell   shift_verbose   sourcepath   xpg_echo


1.6.3 Command line arguments                        *bashsupport-cmdline-args*
----------------------------

The entry 'com. line arg.' calls an input dialog which asks for command line
arguments. These arguments are forwarded to the script which is run by the
'run' entry. The arguments are kept until you change them.

The arguments belong to the current buffer (that is, each buffer can have its
own arguments).
If the buffer gets a new name with "save as" the arguments will now belong to
the buffer with the new name.


1.6.4 START DEBUGGER                                    *bashsupport-debugger*
--------------------

Start the debugger 'bashdb' or the frontend 'ddd' from the menu entry
Run->debug (GUI), with hotkey \rd or F9.  Your version of the bash must be
prepared for debugging and the debugger must be installed (see
http://bashdb.sourceforge.net/).

(1) Using bashdb
When using gvim or vim running under a GUI the debugger will be started in an
independent xterm. This is done because the shell integration in gvim has
deficiencies (see also :h shell-window).

When using vim from a console terminal the debugger will be started as
  :!bash --debugger  <command line arguments>
The debugger now will be run inside vim.

(2) Using ddd
The frontend ddd can be started via the menu or the hotkeys instead of bashdb
as described above.  The preference can be set with the global variable
g:BASH_Debugger (possible values: 'term', 'ddd' ) in '.vimrc' :

  let g:BASH_Debugger     = 'ddd'

The default is 'term'.

In all cases the command line arguments from the argument setting
(|bashsupport-cmdline-args|) are passed to the debugger.


1.6.5 Hardcopy                                          *bashsupport-hardcopy*
--------------

Generates a PostScript file from the whole buffer or from a marked region.

The print header contains date and time for the current locale. The definition
used is

  let s:C_Printheader = "%<%f%h%m%<  %=%{strftime('%x %X')}     Page %N"

The current locale can be overwritten by changing the language, e.g.

  :language C

or by setting a global variable in the file '.vimrc', e.g. :

  let g:C_Printheader = "%<%f%h%m%<  %=%{strftime('%x %X')}     SEITE %N"

See :h printheader and :h strftime()  for more details.


1.6.6 Xterm size                                           *bashsupport-xterm*
----------------

The size of the xterm (see below) can be changes for the current session.  The
size has to be specified as COLUMNS LINES (e.g. 96 32 ).

1.6.7 Output redirection                                  *bashsupport-output*
------------------------

The last menu entry 'output: ... ' has 3 states:
  'output: VIM->buffer->xterm'
  'output: BUFFER->xterm->vim'
  'output: XTERM->vim->buffer'
The first state (upper-case) is the current one.

Target VIM
----------
The script is run from the command line like  ":!${SHELL}  %  arguments".
This is suitable for scripts with dialog elements and few lines of output.

When a script is started this way errors and warnings (if any) are caught in
an error window allowing quickfix commands to be used (see|quickfix|).

Target BUFFER
-------------
The shell output will be displayed in a window with name "Bash-Output".  This
buffer and its content will disappear when the window is closed.  It is not
writable and it has no file. The content could be saved with "save as".
If the output fits completely into this window the cursor will stay in the
script window otherwise the cursor will be set into the output window (you may
want to scroll).
When the script is run again and the output buffer is still open it will be
reused.

The buffer will not be opened if the script does not produce any output.
This is for convenience; you do not have to close an empty buffer.

* This is suitable for scripts without dialog elements and many lines of output
* (e.g. from options like xtrace). Use Vim as pager (scroll, jump, search with
* regular expressions, .. )

Target XTERM
------------
The script will be run in a xterm-window. A wrapper script will ask you to
close this window with Return or <C-D> (bash).
The wrapper shows the complete command line and the return code of the script.

* This is suitable for scripts with dialog elements and many lines of output.
* The xterm is scrollable and independent from the editor window.

Appearance of the xterm
-----------------------
The appearance of the xterm can be controlled by the global variable
g:BASH_XtermDefaults. The assignment

  let g:BASH_XtermDefaults = "-fa courier -fs 10 -geometry 96x32"

placed in '.vimrc' would override the defaults. The defaults are

  "-fa courier -fs 12 -geometry 80x24"

FreeType font 'courier', FreeType font size 12 point, window width 80
characters, window height 24 lines.

The default output method is VIM. The preferred output method can be selected
in '.vimrc' by the global variable g:BASH_OutputGvim, e.g.

  let g:BASH_OutputGvim            = "xterm"

The methods are "vim", "buffer" and "xterm".

==============================================================================
2.  USAGE without GUI  (Vim)                           *bashsupport-usage-vim*
==============================================================================

The frequently used constructs can be inserted with key mappings.  The
mappings are also described in the document 'bash-hot-keys.pdf' (reference
card, part of this package).

 * All mappings (except \lbs and \ubs) are filetype specific: they are only
 * defined for buffers with filetype 'sh' to minimize conflicts with mappings
 * from other plugins.

Hint: Typing speed matters. The combination of a leader ('\') and the
following character(s) will only be recognized for a short time.

  Legend:  (i) insert mode, (n) normal mode, (v) visual mode

4.2  GLOBAL VARIABLES                           *bashsupport-custom-variables*
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Several global variables are checked by the script to customize it:

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
global variable                default value                     tag
                                                               (see |bashsupport-tags|)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
g:BASH_AuthorName              ""                               *|AUTHOR|*
g:BASH_AuthorRef               ""                               *|AUTHORREF|*
g:BASH_Company                 ""                               *|COMPANY|*
g:BASH_CopyrightHolder         ""                               *|COPYRIGHTHOLDER|*
g:BASH_Email                   ""                               *|EMAIL|*
g:BASH_Project                 ""                               *|PROJECT|*

g:BASH_Template_Directory      $HOME."/.vim/bash-support/templates/"
g:BASH_Template_File           "bash-file-header"
g:BASH_Template_Frame          "bash-frame"

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. group: Defines the text which will be inserted for the tags when a template
          is read in (see |bashsupport-tempfiles|).

          g:BASH_AuthorName      : author name
          g:BASH_AuthorRef       : author reference (e.g. acronym)
          g:BASH_Email           : email address
          g:BASH_Company         : name of the company / institution
          g:BASH_Project         : project
          g:BASH_CopyrightHolder : the copyright holder

2. group: Sets the template directory and the names of the template files (see below).

3. group: g:BASH_CodeSnippets    : The name of the code snippet directory
                                   (see |bashsupport-stat-snippets|).
          g:BASH_LoadMenus       : Load menus and mappings ("yes", "no") at start up.
          g:BASH_Dictionary_File : Path and file name of the bash word list used for
                                   dictionary completion (see |bashsupport-dictionary|).
          g:BASH_Root            : The name of the root menu entry of this plugin
                                   (see |bashsupport-custom-root|).

4. group: g:BASH_OutputGvim             : Target for a script output
                                          (see |bashsupport-output|).
          g:BASH_XtermDefaults          : The xterm defaults (see |bashsupport-xterm|).
          g:BASH_LineEndCommColDefault  : default starting column for line end comments
          g:BASH_SyntaxCheckOptionsGlob : shopt options used with syntax checking
          g:BASH_Printheader            : hardcopy header format
          g:BASH_Debugger               : the debugger called by F9 (term, ddd).
          g:BASH_DoOnNewLine            : see |bashsupport-stat-norm-ins|

To override the defaults add appropriate assignments in '.vimrc'.
Here are my settings as an example:

  let g:BASH_AuthorName   = "Dr.-Ing. Fritz Mehner"
  let g:BASH_AuthorRef    = "Mn"
  let g:BASH_Email        = "mehner@fh-swf.de"
  let g:BASH_Company      = "FH Südwestfalen, Iserlohn"

This plugin sets the global variable is_bash:
  let is_bash             = 1
This assignment is necessary to avoid a wrong syntax highlighting for $(..) and
$((..)).

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4.3  THE ROOT MENU                                   *bashsupport-custom-root*
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The variable g:BASH_Root, if set (in '.vimrc' or in '.gvimrc'), gives the name
of the single gVim root menu entry in which the Bash submenus will be put.
The default is
                  'B&ash.'
Note the terminating dot. A single root menu entry is appropriate if the
screen is limited or several plugins are in use.

If g:BASH_Root is set to "", this single root menu entry will not appear.  Put
the following line in '.vimrc'

  let g:BASH_Root = ""

Now all submenus are put into the gVim root menu. Nice for a
Bash-only-programmer and Bash courses.

If you want to set the plugin root menu into another menu, e.g. 'Plugin',
this is done by the following line in '.vimrc'

  let g:BASH_Root = "&Plugin.B&ash."

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4.4  System-wide installation                        *bashsupport-system-wide*
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A system-wide installation (one installation for all users) is done as
follows.

As *** SUPERUSER *** :

(1) Find the Vim installation directory.
The Vim ex command ':echo $VIM' gives '/usr/local/share/vim' or something like
that. Beyond this directory you will find the Vim installation,  e.g. in
'/usr/local/share/vim/vim71' if Vim version 7.1 has been installed.

(2) Create a new subdirectory 'vimfiles', e.g. '/usr/local/share/vim/vimfiles'.

(3) Install Bash Support
Copy the archive 'bash-support.zip' to this new directory and unpack it:
  unzip bash-support.zip

(4) Generate the help tags:
  :helptags $VIM/vimfiles/doc


As *** USER *** :

Create your private snippet directory:

  mkdir --parents  ~/.vim/bash-support/codesnippets

You may want to copy the snippets coming with this plugin (in
$VIM/vimfiles/bash-support/codesnippets) into the new directory or to set a
link to the global directory.


==============================================================================
5.  TEMPLATE FILES AND TAGS                            *bashsupport-tempfiles*
==============================================================================

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5.1  TEMPLATE FILES
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Three menu entries generate block comments:

    bash -> Comments -> Frame Comment
    bash -> Comments -> Function Description
    bash -> Comments -> File Header

The comments which will be inserted by these menu entries are read from
template files:

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
MENU ENTRY              FILE                          GLOBAL VARIABLE
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Frame Comment           bash-frame                    g:BASH_Template_Frame
Function Description    bash-function-description     g:BASH_Template_Function
File Header             bash-file-header              g:BASH_Template_File
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The template files can be written or changed by the user to fulfill special
requirements (layout for a project or work group already exists, file headers /
blocks have to be prepared for a documentation tool, ... ).  They can hold not
only comments but a complete file skeleton if this is necessary.  So you may
want to lay out your own templates.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5.2  TAGS                                                   *bashsupport-tags*
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The comments in these files do not have to be personalized but they can be.
The text can contain the following tags which are replaced by the appropriate
information when the file is read in:

*|AUTHOR|*
*|AUTHORREF|*
*|COMPANY|*
*|COPYRIGHTHOLDER|*
*|EMAIL|*
*|PROJECT|*

*|DATE|*            the preferred date representation for the current locale
                    without the time
*|DATETIME|*        date and time
*|FILENAME|*        filename without path
*|TIME|*            the preferred time representation for the current locale
                    without the date and the time zone or name or abbreviation
*|YEAR|*            the year as a decimal number including the century

*|CURSOR|*          the cursor position after insertion of a template

Each tag can occur more than once. The tag |CURSOR| may appear only once.
The tag |CURSOR| will be the cursor position after the block is read in.
There is no need to use any of these tags, some or all can be missing.

The template files can actually be links pointing to existing templates.

The format for *|DATE|* ,*|TIME|* , and*|YEAR|* can be set by the user. The
defaults are
    *|DATE|*        '%x'
    *|TIME|*        '%X %Z'
    *|YEAR|*        '%Y'
See the manual page of the C function strftime() for the format.  The accepted
format depends on your system, thus this is not portable!  The maximum length
of the result is 80 characters.

User defined formats can be set using the following global variables in
'~/.vimrc' ,  e.g.
    let g:BASH_FormatDate       = '%D'
    let g:BASH_FormatTime       = '%H:%M'
    let g:BASH_FormatYear       = 'year %Y'


==============================================================================
6.  BASH DICTIONARY                                   *bashsupport-dictionary*
==============================================================================

The file 'bash.list' contains words used as dictionary for automatic word
completion.  This feature is enabled by default. The default word list is

  $HOME/.vim/bash-support/wordlists/bash.list

If you want to use an additional list 'MyBash.List' put the following line into
 $HOME/.vimrc :

  let g:BASH_Dictionary_File   =  "$HOME/.vim/bash-support/wordlists/bash.list,".
                              \   "$HOME/.vim/bash-support/wordlists/MyBash.List"

The right side is a comma separated list of files. Note the point at the end
of the first line (string concatenation) and the backslash in front of the
second line (continuation line).
You can use Vim's dictionary feature CTRL-X, CTRL-K (and CTRL-P, CTRL-N).


==============================================================================
7.  Release Notes                                  *bashsupport-release-notes*
==============================================================================

See file 'README.bashsupport'.
